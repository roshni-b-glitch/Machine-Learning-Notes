Based on the notebook file you shared, here are the key conclusions and a simple comparison of the three regression models.



In conclusion, for this specific dataset, the Linear Regression model was the most accurate, providing the best balance of prediction and error.
# Linear Regression
R-squared score (R ): The model had an R2   score of 0.67.
Performance: The average negative mean squared error (MSE) was -25.55.



# Ridge Regression
Best alpha: The best alpha value was found to be 10.
R-squared score (R2): The model had an R2 Score of 0.65.
Performance: The average negative MSE was -25.81.



# Lasso Regression
Best alpha: The best alpha value was 1.
Performance: The average negative MSE was -31.15.




# Compare and Conclusion
# Linear Regression had the best performance on this dataset. It had the highest R-squared score (0.67) and the lowest error (-25.55 negative MSE).

# Ridge Regression performed very similarly to Linear Regression. Its R-squared score (0.65) was a bit lower, and its error was slightly higher (-25.81 negative MSE).

# Lasso Regression had the lowest performance. Its error (-31.15 negative MSE) was the highest among all three models, meaning its predictions were the least accurate.
